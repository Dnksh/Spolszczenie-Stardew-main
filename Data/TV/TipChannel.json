        "25": "Fruit trees. They take an entire season to grow, so plan ahead! If the area directly surrounding your new tree isn't clear, it will interfere with growth. Once your fruit tree is mature, it'll produce delicious fruit for you every day while in season. Better start savin' up!",
        "29": "Summer's here, along with a whole slew of new crops to plant! Take hops, for example. The vines take a while to grow, but once they're mature they can be harvested every day. Good luck!",
